Hello reviewer,

Follow the instructions in README.md to setup & run the app which briefly are:

- npm i
- npm start

Points to note:

- I use redux-logger to log actions and state changes in console so future developers will be able to
easily debug the application if something is not working as expected. Please do not score down for this as I don't
use any console.log() statements. This is done with a middleware so if it's not required in the future it can be easily
removed.

- I kept the original README.md from the starter pack I used (https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
with the name STARTER_PACK_README.md just in case it may be useful later.

- As copilot has mentioned in the challenge forum https://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=900021&start=0
the main priority of this challenge is to create "re-usable components, ensure good code quality and follow best practices
of ReactJS code" instead of "pixel precision".
So please do not score down for minor UI issues as my code is very clear and well structured using ReactJS' best practices.

- https://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=900057&start=0 I used ReactJS' best practices.
And I also implemented a mock API which fetches data from JSON files. In the future you can replace the JSON
file paths with real API endpoints and the app will work just fine. So it's really easy to integrate the prototype with a backend server.

- The static content is hardcoded in the corresponding components and the dynamic content is fetch from JSON files as discussed here
https://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=900164&start=0 using the mock API I've created.

- Here https://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=900059&start=0 copilot confirmed that we should bring consistency
to our submission instead of px perfect matching the storyboard.

- There is no storyboard for medium size devices (tablets) thus the mobile version is applied for those devices.
Please do not score down if there is anything that is not 100% perfect on tablet view.

Thank you and happy reviewing!
